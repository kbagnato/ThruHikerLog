This project was inspired by my 40 day hike across the Rocky Mountains of Colorado via the Colorado Trail.
I was using my notes app to journal my thoughts, and it evolved to record daily stats (time hiked, mileage, vertical, etc).

Front-end:
Angular / TypeScript web app, with NGRX for client-side state management.
